# Adaptive Cleaning Scheduler

An intelligent cleaning task scheduler that adapts to your energy levels and prioritizes tasks based on urgency and importance.

## Overview

The Adaptive Cleaning Scheduler is designed to help you manage household cleaning tasks in a way that respects your energy levels and mental health. Unlike traditional rigid cleaning schedules, this app uses an intelligent algorithm to recommend which tasks need attention based on their priority, when they were last completed, and how much energy you have available.

## Key Features

- **Energy-Adaptive Interface**: Select your current energy level (ðŸ”´ Low, ðŸŸ¡ Moderate, ðŸŸ¢ Good) to receive appropriate recommendations
- **Smart Task Prioritization**: Tasks are ranked by health importance, urgency, and time since last completion
- **Weekly Focus Rotation**: Automatically cycles through focus areas (Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Area, Bedroom/Pet) each week
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Statistics dashboard shows completion rates and streaks
- **Multi-frequency Task Management**: Organizes daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, and quarterly cleaning tasks

## How It Works

### Task Organization

Tasks are categorized by:
- **Priority**: From essential health/hygiene tasks to deep cleaning
- **Time Required**: 2-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, and delegation tasks
- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, and quarterly tasks

### Urgency Calculation

The app calculates an urgency score for each task based on:
- Priority multiplier (higher priority tasks have greater weight)
- Overdue factor (days since last completion relative to expected frequency)

### Energy Level Adaptation

- **Red (Low Energy)**: Only shows essential tasks and limits the number of recommendations
- **Yellow (Moderate Energy)**: Shows a balanced set of high and medium priority tasks
- **Green (Good Energy)**: Provides a full range of tasks including variety options
